"""Z-score normalizer for Tier-A per-station features and AR lag tensor.

Targets and auxiliary targets are intentionally NOT normalized — the
peak-weighted loss thresholds (7.0 elevated, 9.0 flood) are expressed in raw
water-level units, and station-t0 aux targets need to stay comparable to
predictions emitted in raw units at inference time.

Persisted as a pickle alongside the model checkpoint and re-loaded by the
serving predictor; do not change the field names without bumping the artifact
contract.
